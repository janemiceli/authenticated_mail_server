*) IMAP FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE,BODY
*) Rename Aliases -> Distribution Lists or Mailing Lists
*) Move Mailing list "Members" database column to standalone table(lsMailingListMembers).
   Add new functions to API (AddMailingListMember,DeleteMailingListMember,GetMailingListMembers).
   This makes mailing list handling easier and allows very big lists.
*) Move user email addresses "Addresses" database column to stand alone table(lsUserAddresses).
   Add new functions to API (AddUserAddress,DeleteUserAddress,GetUserAddresses).
*) Add postgresql support (Waiting some working .NET pgsql dataprovider)  
*) Block continues bad logins (store bad logins ip to server mem, eg. if badLogin count > 10 (between last 5 minutes) 
   just skip pwd check and return no as login failed)
*) Web Administration
*) Linux (Mono)
*) Check MAIL FORM: address. May be blocks some % of spam messages.
   Check also if local domain and this address exists.
*) IMAP SEARCH command


*) Block API to add duplicate rows. For example 2 users with same login name.
*) Make API as interface and allow server to load module(dll) which completes API commands.
   (This adds possibility to create custom API handlers. For example mssqlAPI.dll, xmlAPI.dll, pgsqlAPI.dll, ... )

*) Tests for API+Server
*) SMTP/POP3/IMAP AUTH (MD5-Digest)
*) Relay (SMTP client) logging

*) News server (NNTP) ??? Integrate with mail server or as separate project
*) Jabber instant messageing ??? 


??? *) Store filters to Sql ? (Now they are local)

??? *) LDAP authentication 


(Some help and suggestions would be nice, but it's always too much requested or hoped)
                                                          
     


//// Future directions
Real domains or virtual servers ?

Real domains - each domain can listen on some or all IP's.This is almost same as now, but access can be limited to specific IP.
For my opinion this isn't good idea, but many mailservers have choosen this way.

virtual servers - each virtual server must be listen on his own IP (if only 1 virtual server, it can listen all IP's), 
each server can have unlimited domains,users,aliases,... .
??? One vitual server can't access other virual server mailboxes.
