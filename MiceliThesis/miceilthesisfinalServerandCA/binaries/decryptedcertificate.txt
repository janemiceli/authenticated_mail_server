If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port 
And the bus is interrupted at a very last resort 
And the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort 
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report. 

If your cursor finds a menu item followed by a dash 
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash 
And your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash 
Then your situation's hopeless, and your system's gonna crash! 

If the label on the cable on the table at your house 
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse 
But your packets want to tunnel unto another protocol 
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall, 
And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss 
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse 
Then you may as well reboot and go out with a bang 
'Cuz sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang! 

When the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk 
And the macrocode instructions cause unnecessary risk 
Then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM. 
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your Mom!
